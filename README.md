# NVIM
> Configuration files and plugins for my NeoVIM setup

## Installation and Usage
- Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/dandeeccastro/nvim ~/.config/nvim` for automatic installation! (kinda)
- Run it and have fun

## Roadmap
- [ ] Packer Bootstrapping is weirdly not functional
- [ ] More keybindings for more convenience
- [ ] LSP conditional loading
- [ ] Update settings on config save
